Give your customers a choice of apparel for your t-shirt designs. Built for with the small screen printing shop and apparel decorators.

== Description ==

This plugin is an addon for WooCommerce to display an apparel selection for purchasing t-shirts, vnecks, hoodies, and more. Apparel choices can be customized by creating a filter and adding it to a product. You can opt into several apparel suppliers including SanMar. More are being added so stay tuned.

Products can have multiple designs with multiple options that include text boxes and drop down lists. Easily create lists in one place and add them to multiple designs - updating easy and effortless.

* In Development *

We are working on a shirt designer that can be added into a WordPress page. Designs can be added from Corel Draw and pushed to the site. We will also have all of the color choices for the designs including ink colors, patterns, and HTV (glitter too!).

== Installation ==

1. Once the plugin is activated select the General menu under Shirt Shopper.
2. If you do not already have a Client Name and Site Key click on the Register button.
3. Fill out all of the fields and click submit.
4. Your account is now activated. Although you can customize the apparel and media (ink, vinyl, and fabric colors), we have set up defaults for you to get you started.
5. Create a new product and select "Apparel Product" next to Product data.
6. Once your product is saved you will see additional selections under the "Apparel" tab.
7. View your product on your site. You should now see a product selection. 

Optional

8. Click on the Shirt Shopper menu and then Design. Add a new design by entering a name and image. If your design has options you can add them here. See the manual for a detailed explanation.
9. You can then add the design that you created earlier. Multiple designs can be placed on a product. This gives you the ability to add designs to the front and back of the shirt as well as the sleeves.

== Screenshots ==
 
1. The Shirt Shopper plugin creates a new apparel selection product tab.
2. Your customers can filter the apparel choices to find the perfect shirt style.
3. Once your customer chooses a style a side bar flys out to pick the color and size as well as any options that you have set up.
4. Once added to the shopping cart you will see the style selected, color, size, and each design that goes with your product.
5. The shopping cart receipt is updated to reflect the entire purchase.
